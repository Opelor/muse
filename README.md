Muse
====

Muse is a Ruby DSL for making music. Unlike MIDI, which is a specification for music in a digital form, Muse actually creates the WAV music files itself.

I haven't created the gem yet, for now to use Muse, download the files, then require 'muse'. 

For examples look into the songs folder.
